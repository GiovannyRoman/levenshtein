#Levenshtein
The Levenshtein application allows users to input the cost of insert, deleting, substituting, and anagrams followed by the starting word and then the ending word.

example:
1 3 1 5

The output will be the lowest cost of getting to the end word and the list of words the program took to reached the end word from start word.
